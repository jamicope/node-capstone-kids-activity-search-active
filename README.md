## Background

I built this app to help parents have one source to find different types of local activities for children in their area, and be able to combine them in one place to make scheduling easier.

## Use Case

This app gives parents acces to 9 different activities, ranging from outdoors to dance, within a 50-mile radius of a chosen city in the US.


## Initial UX

The initial wireframe can be seen below:

## Working Prototype

You can access a working prototype of the app here: https://capstone-kids-activity-search.herokuapp.com/

## Functionality

The app's functionality includes:

Search for children's activities, based on user preference of activity & city.
* Return 25 results.
* Results provide event name, location, time, date and a description.
* The results are in ascending order by date.
* User can add chosen events to "My Planner"
* User can remove events from "My Planner"
* Link to the event website, if available

## Development Roadmap

This is v1.0 of the app, but future enhancements are expected to include:

* The ability to choose multip[le activities at one time
* The ability to increase or decrease the search radius
* The ability to print the activities added to "My Planner"
* Multiple pages of results
* The ability to track events attended
* The ability to comment on attended events to keep notes for the next search
